## Abstract

Machine Learning on graphs, and more generally non-euclidean structured data, has recently emerged as a primary citizen of the machine learning world, with many applications in community detection, recommender systems, natural language processing, molecule classification, protein interface prediction, quantum chemistry, epidemiology, combinatorial optimization... and so on. In particular, deep models such as Graph Neural Networks have become very popular tools, with their successes, limitations, and a plethora of open questions.

This day aims to bring together researchers and students to discuss recent advances in Graph Machine Learning, both theoretical and practical. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Graph Neural Networks, graph kernels
- Statistics on graphs, random graphs
- Graph Signal Processing
- ...

*Graph Shift Operators and Their Relevance to Graph Neural Networks*

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have celebrated many academic and industrial successes in the past years; providing a rich ground for theoretical analysis and achieving state-of-the-art results in several learning tasks. In this talk, we will discuss several approaches to this theoretical analysis with a focus on the role of Graph Shift Operators (GSOs) in GNNs. Informally speaking, GSOs are matrices representing graph structures with the adjacency and Laplacian matrices being the most common GSO choices. We will illustrate this intersection of GNNs and GSOs by looking at an example where we optimise a parametrised GSO in GNN frameworks, and thereby optimally represent graphs leading to performance improvements and interpretable results. We will furthermore discuss theoretical work establishing the potential advantages of enriching the chosen GSO with node feature information. Finally, we will take a look at how the addition of prior cluster information to the GSO can render Graph Autoencoders more suitable for joint community detection and link prediction on various real-world graphs, notably including industrial-scale graphs provided by the Deezer music streaming service.
