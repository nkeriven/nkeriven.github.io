## Short Bio

I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau, France), and obtained the « Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage » (MVA) Master’s degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2014. I prepared my thesis at IRISA, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Rémi Gribonval, and defended it in October, 2017. From 2017 to 2019 I was a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Normale Supérieure with Gabriel Peyré, on the [CFM-ENS](https://data-ens.github.io) "Laplace" chair in data science. I received the Best Student Paper Award at SPARS 2017.
