I am a CNRS researcher with the [GAIA team](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/cics.php) (Geométrie, Algorithmes, Information, Apprentissage) in the [GIPSA laboratory](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/) (Grenoble, France).

## Research Interest

* Signal processing on graphs, graph neural nets
* Random graphs
* Dimensionality reduction and Sparsity

## Misc.

I co-organize the [GAIA seminars](https://gaia.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/seminar/), do not hesitate to subscribe to the mailing list for news.

I have been awarded an [ANR JCJC](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/programme-jeunes-chercheuses-jeunes-chercheurs-jcjc/) grant for my project [GRandMa](/grandma/) (Random Graphs in Machine learning). See [here](/grandma/) for job openings.

See [Events](/events/) for more.

## Short Bio

I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau, France), and obtained the « Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage » (MVA) Master’s degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2014. I prepared [my PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01620815/) at IRISA, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Rémi Gribonval, and defended it in October, 2017. From 2017 to 2019 I was a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Normale Supérieure with Gabriel Peyré, on the [CFM-ENS](https://data-ens.github.io) "Laplace" chair in data science, before joining CNRS in 2019 as a full-time researcher. I received the Best Student Paper Award at [SPARS 2017](http://spars2017.lx.it.pt/) and the [Early Career Prize](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/special-events/is22-special-events) of the SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science in 2022. I am the PI of [ANR JCJC GRandMa](/grandma/), starting in 2021.
