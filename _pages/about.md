I am a CNRS researcher with the [COMPACT team](https://team.inria.fr/sirocco/fr/) at [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) (Rennes, France).

## Research Interest

* Machine learning and Signal processing on graphs, GNNs
* Random graphs
* Dimensionality reduction and Sparsity

## Misc.

I have been awarded an ERC Starting Grant for my project [MALAGA](/malaga/). See [here](/malaga/) for job openings. Do not hesitate to contact me even if no job offer is currently posted!

We organize a GdR IASIS/RADIA [thematic day](https://gdr-iasis.cnrs.fr/reunions/apprentissage-et-graphes/) on Graph Machine Learning and GNNs, March 31st at IHP Paris. Send us an abstract if you wanna present something!

## Short Bio

I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau, France), and obtained the « Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage » (MVA) Master’s degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2014. I prepared [my PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01620815/) at IRISA, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Rémi Gribonval, and defended it in October, 2017. From 2017 to 2019 I was a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Normale Supérieure with Gabriel Peyré, on the [CFM-ENS](https://data-ens.github.io) "Laplace" chair in data science, before joining CNRS in 2019 as a full-time researcher. I received the Best Student Paper Award at [SPARS 2017](http://spars2017.lx.it.pt/) and the [Early Career Prize](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/special-events/is22-special-events) of the SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science in 2022. I am the PI of [ERC StG MALAGA](/grandma/), starting in 2025.

I play the piano, generally [with a singer](https://youtube.com/@bluecurlmusic) or [solo](https://youtube.com/@nicolaskeriven). Check out our first single!
